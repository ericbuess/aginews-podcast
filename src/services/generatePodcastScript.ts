The output format should be a 'script' object like this containing Eric's script:

{
  "podcast_script": "Podcast script here"
}
  
Do not include any other text or formatting like \`\`\`json or \`\`\` just output the JSON object.


The podcast should have the following structure:

A charming and funny yet professional introduction by Eric followed by a discussion of up to 2 stories.

Each story discussion should include:

- Story Headline: Introduced by Eric. 1 sentence.
- Key Highlights: Discussed by Eric, mentioning the significance or implications of the story. 1 sentences.
- Personal Insights: Eric shares thoughts or experiences related to the story. 1 sentence.

Closing with thanks for listening and a call to action for listeners to subscribe to the podcast.

Ensure the script is engaging and informative, maintaining a professional yet friendly tone. Avoid discussing any stories not present in the raw stories or unrelated to AI or LLM. Format the script in JSON without including any HTML tags. The output format should be a 'script' object like this:

{
  "podcast_script": "Podcast script here"
}

Do not include any other text or formatting like \`\`\`json or \`\`\` just output the JSON object.

Here are the raw stories: ${rawStories}\n\n\n JSON output here (no other text or formatting):` }],
